  - Documentation-first development

- **Best Practices:**
  - Right-sizing your agent team
  - Agent handoff clarity
  - Documentation cadence
  - Quality gates by project type

### 2. AGENT_ROSTER_ANALYSIS.md (23,295 bytes)
**Purpose:** Deep analysis identifying gaps, overlaps, and improvements needed.

**Key Findings:**

**Critical Gaps (Agents Referenced But Missing):**
1. **database-architect** - Referenced by 3+ agents
   - Schema design, query optimization, migrations
   - Rails projects use rails-activerecord-expert as workaround
   - Other stacks have no database specialist

2. **security-guardian** - Referenced by 3+ agents
   - Security audits, vulnerability scanning, OWASP compliance
   - Currently handled partially by code-reviewer (not specialized)

3. **devops-engineer** - Referenced by performance-optimizer
   - CI/CD, containerization, cloud infrastructure
   - Currently handled by general engineer (suboptimal)

4. **refactoring-expert** - Referenced by 2 agents
   - Systematic refactoring, technical debt reduction
   - No dedicated agent for large-scale refactoring

5. **accessibility-expert** - Referenced by frontend-developer
   - WCAG compliance, screen reader testing, a11y audits
   - Basic a11y knowledge in frontend-developer (not comprehensive)

**Overlap Ambiguities:**
- **Architecture roles:** code-architect vs api-architect (needs boundary docs)
- **Developer roles:** engineer vs specialists (healthy flexibility, needs priority docs)
- **Testing roles:** coverage-analyzer vs playwright-analyzer (clear separation needed)

**Delegation Chain Issues:**
- 6 broken references to non-existent agents
- Potential circular delegation in refactoring workflows
- Missing direct paths for common scenarios

**Recommendations:**
- **Immediate:** Create 3 critical agents (database, security, DevOps)
- **Short-term:** Add refactoring and accessibility specialists
- **Strategic:** Document agent selection hierarchy, create team templates

**Unique Value:**
- Identifies specific gaps blocking workflows
- Proposes concrete agent roster expansion (24 → 28+ agents)
- Provides actionable recommendations with priority levels

---

### 3. README.md (New - Master Index)
**Purpose:** Navigation hub for all documentation.

**Features:**
- Quick reference tables for common scenarios
- Agent category breakdown with counts
- Known issues summary
- Document status tracking
- Usage guides for different user types
- Contributing guidelines

**Unique Value:**
- Single entry point for all documentation
- Quick access to most common use cases
- Shows relationships between documents

## Key Insights

### 1. Agent Roster is Strong for Web Apps
The current 24-agent roster provides excellent coverage for:
- Rails applications (3 specialized agents)
- React applications (3 specialized agents)
- Universal web development (4 universal agents)

### 2. Infrastructure Gaps Are Critical
Missing specialists create broken delegation chains:
- 6 agents try to delegate to non-existent specialists
- Common scenarios (security audit, DB optimization, deployment) lack direct paths
- Workarounds exist but are suboptimal

### 3. Healthy Overlap Exists
Some overlaps are features, not bugs:
- Engineer vs specialists: Provides flexibility for different project scales
- Multiple architects: Each has clear domain (system, API, implementation)
- Testing agents: Clear separation by test type (fast vs slow)

These overlaps just need better documentation, not elimination.

### 4. Documentation Was the Missing Piece
The agent system was well-designed but lacked:
- Clear guidance on which agent to use when
- Documentation of agent selection hierarchy
- Concrete examples of agent composition
- Gap visibility (referenced agents that don't exist)

### 5. Five Critical Agents Needed
Adding these would make the roster comprehensive:
1. database-architect (schema, queries, migrations)
2. security-guardian (audits, vulnerabilities, compliance)
3. devops-engineer (CI/CD, containers, cloud)
4. refactoring-expert (technical debt, systematic refactoring)
5. accessibility-expert (WCAG, a11y compliance)

## How to Use These Documents

### For Developers

**Starting a new feature:**
1. Check [AGENT_APPLICATIONS.md](./AGENT_APPLICATIONS.md) for your project type
2. Follow the recommended agent workflow
3. Use the best practices section for quality gates

**Stuck on which agent to use:**
1. Check [README.md](./README.md) Quick Reference tables
2. Review [AGENT_ROSTER_ANALYSIS.md](./AGENT_ROSTER_ANALYSIS.md) for agent boundaries
3. Start with engineer if still unclear (can always escalate to specialists)

### For Agent System Designers

**Expanding the agent roster:**
1. Review [AGENT_ROSTER_ANALYSIS.md - Identified Gaps](./AGENT_ROSTER_ANALYSIS.md#identified-gaps)
2. Prioritize based on Immediate/Short-term/Strategic recommendations
3. Follow the proposed agent specifications
4. Update delegation chains in existing agents

**Resolving agent confusion:**
1. Check [AGENT_ROSTER_ANALYSIS.md - Overlapping Responsibilities](./AGENT_ROSTER_ANALYSIS.md#overlapping-responsibilities)
2. Add "When to use" sections to agent definitions
3. Document the selection hierarchy in team-configurator

### For Project Managers

**Setting up a new project:**

## Conclusion

This documentation session successfully:

✅ **Identified critical gaps** in the agent roster  
✅ **Clarified overlapping responsibilities** between agents  
✅ **Provided concrete usage guidance** for different scenarios  
✅ **Created actionable recommendations** for improvement  
✅ **Established documentation structure** for future updates  

The agent system is well-designed but was missing documentation to make it 
discoverable and usable. These documents provide that missing layer, enabling both 
new and experienced users to effectively leverage the agent ecosystem.

**Most important finding:** Five missing agents (database, security, DevOps, 
refactoring, accessibility) are blocking complete workflows. Adding these would 
transform the roster from "good for web apps" to "comprehensive for modern software 
development."
